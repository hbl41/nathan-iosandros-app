# Nathan's Iosandros Companion Site

A personal companion site for **Gaius** in the Iosandros campaign, hosted at `nathan.iosandros.com`. It ships with five standard pages — **Character, Play Tracker, 13 Kingdoms, History, Map**. The three world pages work out of the box; the Character and Play Tracker pages get personalized to your sheet when you run Claude. Add more pages later if you want.

You're not editing code by hand. You hand the repo + your character sheet to Claude, and Claude fills in the personal pages. This README is the orientation — read it once, then use the prompt at the bottom.

## What's already set up

You don't have to think about any of this — it's the scaffold Brady built:

| Piece | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Cloudflare Pages** | Hosts the site at `nathan.iosandros.com`. Auto-deploys every time you push to GitHub. |
| **D1 database** (binding `PLAYER_DB`) | Server-side persistent storage — no localStorage. Changes like HP, FP, and notes save between sessions and across devices (phone, laptop, iPad — same data). |
| **Auto-migration runner** | When Claude adds a new table, the runner applies it on first request after deploy. You don't run anything by hand. |
| **Shared world data** | The 13 kingdoms, territories, prophecies, calendar, and in-world history are in `data/data.js` — read-only world canon. No character-specific data is pre-loaded (no NPC seed, no character sheet). |
| **Backend API** | `/api/people`, `/api/events/`, `/api/state/[key]`, `/api/health` already work. Claude wires the UI to these. |
| **Five standard pages** | Tab shell + the three world pages (13 Kingdoms, History, Map) are pre-built and identical across every player site. Character + Play Tracker are personalized to your sheet by Claude. |
| **Coding guidelines** | A `CLAUDE.md` in the repo — Claude Code auto-loads it and works by its rules (think before coding, keep it simple, surgical edits). Scoped to this project, not your whole account. |

## The five standard pages

Every player site ships with the same five tabs:

| Page | State | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| **13 Kingdoms** | ✅ Works now | Renders from `data/data.js` — same world for every player |
| **History** | ✅ Works now | The in-world timeline from `data/data.js` |
| **Map** | ✅ Works now | `assets/map.jpg` — drag to pan, scroll to zoom |
| **Character** | ⬜ Claude fills in | Your sheet, rendered by `renderCharacter()` in `js/app.js` |
| **Play Tracker** | ⬜ Claude fills in | Your mid-session trackers (HP, resources, notes) via `renderTracker()` |

The two blank pages show a "not set up yet" message until you run Claude. The shell, styling, and the three world pages are already built — Claude's job is to fill the two personal pages from your character sheet (plus a migration that saves your sheet to the database).

## What you do

It's three steps — **Step 1** gets you set up, **Step 2** builds your site, **Step 3** is ongoing refinement. Claude handles the technical parts; you mostly answer its questions. You're not expected to know any of this already.

1. **GitHub account.** No account? Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com). Then send Brady your username so he can add you as a collaborator on `hbl41/nathan-iosandros-app`, and accept the invite GitHub emails you.

2. **Make an `Iosandros` folder** on your computer and gather your materials in it: your character sheet, plus any campaign info you have — history documents, any notes from your session zero. Anything you want your site to know about Gaius and the world goes here. Claude Code focuses on this folder and asks before touching anything outside it.

3. **Step 1 — get set up.** Install Claude Code from [claude.com/claude-code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (a command or two — follow their page), run it in your Iosandros folder, and paste the **Step 1 prompt** (below). Claude Code connects GitHub, clones this repo into the folder, and confirms you can push — one step at a time.

4. **Step 2 — build your site.** Run Claude Code inside the repo and just tell it **"do Step 2"** — it reads the instructions from the repo and builds your Character + Play Tracker pages from your sheet. (Prefer to paste the exact prompt? It's in the **Step 2 prompt** section below.)

5. **Step 3 — refine & expand (ongoing).** From here it's just conversation with Claude in the repo: restyle it (colors, fonts, the whole look), change the layout, add features, or add whole new pages — inventory, an NPC tracker, a quest log, whatever you want. No fixed prompt for this; just ask. When you're happy with a change, say "commit and push," then tap **↻ Refresh** to see it live.

6. **Something broken on the site itself?** Send Brady a screenshot — anything Cloudflare-side is his to fix, not yours.

---

## Step 1 prompt — get set up

First install Claude Code from [claude.com/claude-code](https://claude.com/claude-code) — a command or two, follow their page. Then open a terminal in your **Iosandros** folder, run `claude`, and paste this:

````
I just installed Claude Code and I'm running you inside a folder called
"Iosandros" that has my character sheet and campaign notes in it. I'm NOT
technical — go ONE STEP AT A TIME and wait for me to confirm each step
worked before the next.

Get me set up to edit and push my website's code:
1. Check whether I have git and the GitHub CLI (`gh`); help me install
   whatever's missing
2. Sign me in to GitHub — give me the `gh auth login` command to run myself
   (it's interactive): choose GitHub.com -> HTTPS -> say YES to
   "authenticate Git" so I can push
3. Set my git identity: `git config --global user.name` and
   `git config --global user.email` (my name + the email on my GitHub)
4. Clone hbl41/nathan-iosandros-app into this folder (Brady added me as a
   collaborator), so it lands at Iosandros/nathan-iosandros-app
5. Confirm pushing works: cd into the repo and run `git push` — it should
   say "Everything up-to-date"

Show me exactly what to type at each step and fix any errors before moving
on. When we're done, tell me to run you inside the nathan-iosandros-app folder
and paste my Step 2 prompt there.
````

## Step 2 prompt — build your site

Once Claude Code is running in the repo, you can just say **"do Step 2"** — it follows these instructions (they're committed in the repo, and `CLAUDE.md` tells Claude where to find them). The exact prompt is here too if you'd rather paste it:

````
I'm a player in the Iosandros D&D campaign — my character is Gaius. My
character sheet and any campaign notes are in this repo's parent folder (the
"Iosandros" folder, one level up). Read them.

This repo is my companion site, already deployed. Read README.md and
CLAUDE.md first — they explain how it's built and the ground rules. The
"two render hooks" and "Example: seeding the character sheet" sections of
README.md show exactly what to build.

Your job: build my two personal pages — Character and Play Tracker — from my
character sheet. The other three tabs (13 Kingdoms, History, Map) are already
done; leave them alone.

Start by asking me what I want on each page. Then build one piece at a time,
showing me as you go. When I'm happy, commit and push.

```

### The two render hooks

`js/app.js` builds the three world pages itself. The two personal pages are left for Claude:

- `renderCharacter()` — already fetches the `character` state; fill the body to render the sheet.
- `renderTracker()` — already fetches the `tracker` state; fill the body with mid-session controls. Save edits with `saveState('tracker', next)`.

Helpers exposed for use in those functions (and any files Claude adds): `window.IO = { $, $$, el, fetchState, saveState, activateTab }`.

### D1 binding

The D1 database is bound as `env.PLAYER_DB` in every Pages Function. Always go through `requireDb(env)` from `functions/lib/http.js` — it throws a helpful 500 if the binding isn't configured.

### Existing tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `_health` | Trivial row for the health check. |
| `_migrations_log` | Tracks which migrations have been applied. Don't touch by hand. |
| `people` | Party + NPCs. Empty by default — seed via a migration or add through `/api/people`. |
| `campaign_events` | In-game dated entries. CRUD via `/api/events`. |
| `app_state` | Key/value singletons (`character`, `tracker`, `notes`, `session`, `date`, `budget`, `advantage`, `kingdomFilter`). Get/set via `/api/state/[key]`. |

The allowed `app_state` keys are gated by `ALLOWED_KEYS` in `functions/lib/app-state.js` — add to that set when you introduce a new key.

### Adding a new D1 table

1. Create `migrations/000N_<name>.js` exporting `{ id, statements: [...] }` (an array of single SQL statements — see existing migrations). Use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`.
2. Import it in `migrations/index.js` and append to the `MIGRATIONS` array.
3. Push to GitHub. On the next deploy, the first request triggers the migration runner, which applies pending migrations in order and records each in `_migrations_log`.

### API conventions

- Endpoint files use `onRequestGet`, `onRequestPost`, etc. (Cloudflare Pages Functions naming).
- Always use the helpers in `functions/lib/http.js`: `json()`, `handleError()`, `requireDb()`, `requireUser()`, `readJson()`.
- Wrap handlers in `try/catch` and return `handleError(error)` on throw.
- Validation lives in `functions/lib/*.js` next to the relevant table.

### Auth

The backend reads the user identity from Cloudflare Access headers (`cf-access-authenticated-user-email` or a JWT cookie). Brady will turn CF Access on for `nathan.iosandros.com` so only you can write to your D1. You don't need to do anything for auth — just know it's there.

---

## Example: seeding the character sheet

When Claude generates your first migration to put your character data into `app_state`, it should look like this (modeled on Brady's Caeto seed):

```js
// migrations/0005_character_seed.js
export default {
  id: "0005_character_seed",
  statements: [
    `INSERT INTO app_state (key, value, updated_at, updated_by)
     VALUES (
       'character',
       '<JSON.stringify(gaiusCharacterSheet) — escape single quotes by doubling them>',
       '<ISO timestamp>',
       'seed'
     )
     ON CONFLICT(key) DO NOTHING`,
  ],
};
```

Then append `import m0005 from "./0005_character_seed.js";` and add `m0005` to the `MIGRATIONS` array in `migrations/index.js`.

The `ON CONFLICT(key) DO NOTHING` is intentional: once the row exists, future edits made through the app's UI won't be overwritten by a re-run of the seed.

## When something breaks

| Problem | Who fixes |
|---|---|
| Site not loading at all | Brady (Cloudflare / DNS) |
| `/api/health` returns 500 about `PLAYER_DB` | Brady (D1 binding not configured) |
| Migration failed on deploy | You — read the error in Cloudflare logs, fix the migration file, push again |
| Bad UI bug | You + Claude — describe what's broken, ask Claude to fix |
| Auth not working | Brady (CF Access config) |
| Want a new feature | You + Claude |

Cloudflare logs for your site live at [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) under Workers & Pages → nathan-iosandros-app → **Logs**. Brady can grant you read access if you want to debug yourself.

## Setup help (for Claude, in Step 1)

When a player runs the Step 1 prompt, here's the reference for walking them through it — they are non-technical, so go one step at a time and confirm each worked.

**Mac:** `git` comes with `xcode-select --install`. Easiest GitHub sign-in is the GitHub CLI: install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) → `brew install gh` → `gh auth login` (GitHub.com → HTTPS → **say YES to "authenticate Git"** → browser). Set their identity: `git config --global user.name "..."` and `git config --global user.email "..."`. Then `cd` into their **Iosandros** folder, `gh repo clone hbl41/nathan-iosandros-app`, `cd nathan-iosandros-app`, `claude`.

**Windows:** [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) + [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) + Claude Code, then the same `gh auth login` (authenticate Git: yes) + `git config` identity + clone + `claude` flow in Git Bash, inside the Iosandros folder.

Confirm push access with `git push` — it should say "Everything up-to-date" (proves their credentials work). The player should end Step 1 with Claude Code running in their cloned repo (`Iosandros/nathan-iosandros-app`), able to push, with their character sheet + notes one level up — ready for the Step 2 prompt.
